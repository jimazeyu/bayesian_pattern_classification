# bayesian-pattern-classification
This repository implements a range of Bayesian-based statistical learning methods for the task of image segmentation. We focus on leveraging advanced algorithms such as Maximum A Posteriori (MAP), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Expectation-Maximization (EM) to effectively segment images.
